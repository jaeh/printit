#####what is this printit stuff about?

we will create a ruleset for space battles (at first), 
playing in a galaxy of vast undiscovered space.

every- and anyone will be able to create 3d models using any tool that exports data 3d printers understand,

then upload them and create rules and lore for them, 
keeping the galaxy constantly growing and changing.

once the models have been checked (mainly for copyright infringement) by us they will be included into the official release,
enabling any- and everyone
to print that model using a 3d-printer, for example [this one](http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2.html), [this one](http://cubify.com/cube/) or [this one](https://grrf.de/de/catalog/3d-drucker-protos-x400/grrf-protos-x400) or [this one](http://cb-printer.com/en/shop/3d-printer-cb-printer-com/).


we estimate that the cost of buying the printer and the plastic will equal around 3 armies of your favorite commercial game.
get the printer together with your friends and it will be worth the investment.
those printers can print [other] [cool] [stuff] [too] [btw], [they] [are] [a] [great] [move] [towards] [consumer] [freedom],
and isnt that what we all want?

this will be the first game that enables YOU to play with YOUR models.
if you cant or dont want to build models yourself,
you will at least have chosen them from a collection of models that you could adapt and still can after printing them.
want a new gun? just takes 5 minutes to print it, then stick it onto your model.
want a new ship? well, in about 20 minutes to an hour you have it.
you can take existing spaceship designs and expand on them, change them and let them evolve,
nobody can stop your imagination and nobody can tell you what to buy.

this is the real power of free and open games.
the power to really create the things YOU want to see in YOUR game.
because, after all, you are the game.

this may sound like a lame marketing speech, but dont be fooled, we are not marketeers.

we are gamers that finally want to play games that use modern technology in the background to enhance them.
we want to have a social network of gamers that play the game.

we want to know how games that others played turned out and we want to use this data to make balancing better and better.

we want to play a game where we have control over our board, where we can replace missing parts easily and cheap 

we want to play a game that has rules in a compact and welldefined form. 
preferably with hyperlinks in the rules that are on our phones, laptops or tablets ;) 
no more books that gather dust and cost a fortune,
just a few megabyte of data on our devices that we can navigate as easily as possible.
