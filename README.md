###printit. games that matter.
#####making games as free as they should be.


###synopsis:

#####what is this printit stuff about?

we will create a ruleset, that enables every- and anyone to create 3d models using any tool 

which can output data that can be used with 3d printers,

then upload them to our page and create rules for them.

after that there will be the possibility for you or anyone else

to print that model using a 3d-printer, for example one of [](those), [](those) or [](those). 
(if you want to keep it private, just dont upload it. see [](below) why you will miss out then)

we guess that the cost of buying the printer and the plastic will equal 1, 2 or 3 armies for your favorite commercial game.

with the slight difference, that YOU will have built YOUR models. if not, you will at least have chosen them from a collection of models that you could adapt and still can.
you can take existing spaceship designs and expand on them

nobody can tell you how they have to look like, they just have to obey the rules.

(we discourage copying from copyrighted material, thats just not the spirit of free and open source! 

as long as you build your own models you are free to copy whatever you want, you are just not allowed to 

nobody can stop you, no commercial fan-fiction is not copyrightable,

so as long as you dont try to sell copyrighted or trademarked models there can never be a problem.

we are an ngo. we will be non profit.

we will have employees that design our universe to an extend where we have a good repertoire,

but beyond that we only want to finally play a free game.

not free as in free beer. free as in free people.

and whilst we strongly encourage people to print our models themselves, we will also find a way to sell them in the future.

maybe.

if we get desperate for money or if you, the customer, really demands it :p


we will at first create the ruleset for spaceship battles,

mainly because the ruleset for one solar system can be simplified quite a lot,

as well as the rules for spaceships are.
