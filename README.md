###printit. games that matter.
#####making games as free as they should be.

#####what is this printit stuff about?

we will create a ruleset, that enables every- and anyone to create 3d models using any tool which can output data that can be used with 3d printers,

then upload them to our page and create rules for them.

after that there will be the possibility for you or anyone else

to print that model using a 3d-printer, for example [this one](http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2.html), [this one](http://cubify.com/cube/) or [this one](https://grrf.de/de/catalog/3d-drucker-protos-x400/grrf-protos-x400) or [this one](http://cb-printer.com/en/shop/3d-printer-cb-printer-com/).

we estimate that the cost of buying the printer and the plastic will equal around 3 armies of your favorite commercial game.
get the printer together with your friends and it will be worth the investment.

this will be the first game that enables YOU to play with YOUR models.
if not, you will at least have chosen them from a collection of models that you could adapt and still can.
want a new gun? just takes 10 minutes to print it.
want a new ship? well, in a few hours you have it.
you can take existing spaceship designs and expand on them, change them and let them evolve,
nobody can stop your imagination.

this is the real power of free and open games.
the power to really create the things YOU want to see in YOUR game.
because, after all, you are the game.
