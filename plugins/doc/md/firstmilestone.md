# First Milestone

## Milestone

### Target : 
Build a Web interface that generates the ship properties according to the equipped weapons, modules etc (see Game Unit Properties)
This values will be visualized in this "generator" with eventually an 3D model of the selected ship.         

    1. Ship Value Generator Web interface
        1.0 Interface that shows all ship options. more about what needs to be shown below:
        1.1 Ship generator interface
            Choose a Ship class (Depending on Ship Size)
                Fighter 
                Frigate
                etc
        1.2 Weapons generator
        1.3 Module generator
        1.4 Obstacle Generator
        1.5 the end result will be a complete ship.
            it will be able to do anything thats allowed by the rules after the three steps above. 


### Basic Ship requirements 
- keep it simple 
- Ships should have all the values that EVERY ship will need later on. nothing special.
- Complexity on this stage should basically be nonexistent


### Early Basic Gameplay (Simple Mode)
- Game Size : 5 -10 Fighters 
- Fighters are customizable (in early stage minimalistic customization options)  
- try to get a first feeling for balancing.
   

## Thinking

    What does the user ? 
    
    1. Select the Ship Classes --> BASE ATTRIBUTES
    2. Select ship modules like weapons engine etc dependent on the ship class and size
    3. Calculate the actual Ship Attributes and visalise these attributes 
    4. Visualize the new Ships Shape


## User Interface - Ship Value Generator
     
### Possibility 1 
     
    Play Card Design

    Visualisation of the entries will be done via Cards which will select the Category
    or Entry.
    
    Example
    
        1. First selected the Ship type class. Which will you now give you the option of the Ship module Classes.
        ....
      
      
## Possibility 2

    Table Visualistation. Selection of the entrie gives you more information of the entrie .... 
    
## Possibility 3

    Autocompletion Style. (Expert mode). The user knows what to search like https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen.
    
## Possibility 4

    Like Card style with https://github.com/desandro/masonry DEMO http://masonry.desandro.com/
