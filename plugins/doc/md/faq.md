# FAQ


###Whom am i playing?
  You are playing beings of a race you choose. You can freely create their story and even their ships.


###What classes of ships do exist?
  
  - Fighter (Prior. 1) (1.5 - 4cm)
  - Frigate (Prior. 1) (4 - 8 cm)
  - Cruiser (Future) (8 - 14cm)
  - Battleship (Future) (15 - 20cm)
  - PlanetClass (Future) (20 - 25cm)
  - StarClass (Future) (25-50cm)


###What does size mean?
  size basically is the size of the ship in cm times the scale of the battle.
  A fighter can be 1 or 10cm big, just as you wish, 
  a battleship will always be around 8-10 times larger than the fighter though.
  We will eventually settle on a fixed scale depending on the minimum printable shipsize,
  and it seems as if the smallest ships/torpedoes/rockes will be around 1.5cm.
          

###What weapon classes will be available? 
  Weapon classes dont really exist.
  There are ammunition types like lazzzor, pulse, rocket and torpedo.
  Very large ships can even launch squadrons of other ships.


###What are modules ?
  Modules are parts of your ships. There are multiple types of modules,
  armors, hulls, shields, slots, sensors, generators, engines and weapons.



###How does this all work? Isnt this incredibly complicated?
  Well, in the old times of rules inside books, unchangeably written 
  and without a possibility to browse easily,
  one could literally get drowned in the dozens and dozens of rulebooks. 
  Heck, i know that i have read more than 100 rulebooks in my life...
  Now that we have the internet, everything is getting easy. 
  You just choose a frame, then choose some modules that fit 
  into the frame and the ship is done.
  To create a crew and a captain is a bit more work, 
  but even that is incredibly easy once you get comfortable with the ui.
  And you learn the rules while you explore your options.
  In a game. (hopefully).
