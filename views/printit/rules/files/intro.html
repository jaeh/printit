{{testing}} is a game of space battles. this means that there is a vastness of empty space on your battlefields.
your ships only occupy spaces as big as grains of sand.

since that wouldnt be too easy to 3dprint and wouldnt look as nice, we decided to scale em up a bit. about a thousand times.
now they are nicely sized and visible and we can assemble and paint them quite easily.
